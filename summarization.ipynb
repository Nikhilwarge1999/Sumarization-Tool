I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme.

      "\n",
      "The speaker visited the Car-Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami and was impressed by the islanders' resilience and community spirit. Despite many losses, the islanders took in affected victims as their own children, eliminating the need for orphanages. Inspired by their courage, the speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which they sang together with the villagers, showcasing their enthusiasm and determination to overcome adversity. The speech then shifts to mention the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but the main focus is on the Car-Nicobar islanders' unique trait of community and courage in the face of disaster.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering members of society, particularly the youth, to achieve their goals and create a better future.

Abdul Kalam emphasizes the need for 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide. Additionally, his meetings with over 15 lakh youth, representing the dreams of 540 million young Indians, emphasized the need to guide their aspirations towards a prosperous, safe, and proud India. He also shared his experience of meeting over 6000 farmers from different states, who showed interest in the various gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and highlighted the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources, improve the economic conditions of the nation, and empower farmers for a second green revolution, as agriculture is the backbone of the nation. Moreover, Abdul Kalam expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries, and emphasized the importance of protecting and nurturing fertile land for a second green revolution.

      "APJ Abdul Kalam delivers a farewell speech after 5 years at Rashtrapati Bhavan, expressing gratitude and sharing experiences from his tenure, highlighting 10 key messages including accelerating development, empowering villages, and a youth movement for a Developed India 2020. These messages were inspired by interactions with the youth, such as a question from a young girl named Anukriti who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. He also drew inspiration from his visit to Nagaland, where he witnessed the empowerment of village councils, and initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex, which demonstrates the potential for transformation in India's 600,000 villages through empowerment and connectivity. The PURA complex has shown remarkable results, with the establishment of health care centers, education and vocational training centers, leading to large-scale employment generation and entrepreneurship, as well as the development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land. Furthermore, successful cooperative ventures, such as the one in Thanjavur district, have enhanced the innovative ability of villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products. Abdul Kalam emphasizes the need for 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide. Additionally, his meetings with over 15 lakh youth, representing the dreams of 540 million young Indians, emphasized the need to guide their aspirations towards a prosperous, safe, and proud India. He also shared his experience of meeting over 6000 farmers from different states, who showed interest in the various gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and highlighted the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources, improve the economic conditions of the nation, and empower farmers for a second green revolution, as agriculture is the backbone of the nation. Moreover, Abdul Kalam expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries, and emphasized the importance of protecting and nurturing fertile land for a second green revolution. His interactions with individuals, including those who have overcome significant challenges, have inspired him to promote a mindset of defeating problems and succeeding, as exemplified by his meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who despite being born without hands and legs, remains optimistic and grateful.\n",

These messages were inspired by interactions with the youth, such as a question from a young girl named Anukriti who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. He also drew inspiration from his visit to Nagaland, where he witnessed the empowerment of village councils, and initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex, which demonstrates the potential for transformation in India's 600,000 villages through empowerment and connectivity. The PURA complex has shown remarkable results, with the establishment of health care centers, education and vocational training centers, leading to large-scale employment generation and entrepreneurship, as well as the development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land. Furthermore, successful cooperative ventures, such as the one in Thanjavur district, have enhanced the innovative ability of villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products. Abdul Kalam emphasizes the need for 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide. Additionally, his meetings with over 15 lakh youth, representing the dreams of 540 million young Indians, emphasized the need to guide their aspirations towards a prosperous, safe, and proud India. He believes that the youth are the most powerful resource and need to be empowered through value-based education and leadership. He also shared his experience of meeting over 6000 farmers from different states, who showed interest in the various gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and highlighted the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources, improve the economic conditions of the nation, and empower farmers for a second green revolution, as agriculture is the backbone of the nation. Moreover, Abdul Kalam expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries, and emphasized the importance of protecting and nurturing fertile land for a second green revolution. His interactions with individuals, including those who have overcome significant challenges, have inspired him to promote a mindset of defeating problems and succeeding. Abdul Kalam also stresses the importance of preserving India's rich and diverse cultural treasures for future generations, and notes that every sector of the country has given him confidence that India can become a developed nation before 2020, driven by the spirit of empowerment and the willingness of its people to contribute to the nation's growth. Ultimately, Abdul Kalam envisions a developed India 2020 with a distinctive profile, where the rural and urban divide is minimized, there is equitable distribution of energy and quality water, and the agriculture, industry, and service sectors work in harmony, with education and value systems accessible to all, regardless of societal or economic background. This vision is further elaborated as a nation that attracts the most talented scholars, scientists, and investors, provides the best healthcare to all, has responsive and corruption-free governance, and has eradicated poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children, ultimately becoming a prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation with sustainable growth.\""
